# insiders

Manage your Insiders projects.

## Installation

```
pip install insiders

```

With [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```
uv tool install insiders

```

## Usage

The `insiders` tool provides several commands that will help you manage projects based on a sponsorware strategy.

- `insiders backlog`: Print a backlog of issues, ordered using your own defined criteria
- `insiders index`: Serve a PyPI-like index locally, and upload private Insiders packages to it.
- `insiders project`: Bootstrap public/insiders project pairs on GitHub.
- `insiders sponsors`: Manage your sponsors (grant/revoke access to private team, etc.).

Run `insiders -h` to see where the configuration file is found. Example configuration:

```

# **`project`**

## **`create`**

> Create public/insiders repositories.

This command will do several things:

- Create public and insiders repositories on GitHub (using the provided namespace, username, repository name, description, etc.).
- Clone these two repositories locally (using the provided repository paths).
- Optionally initialize the public repository by generating initial contents using the specified [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) template and answers.
- Optionally run a post creation command into the public repository.
- Pull the public contents into the insiders clone (by declaring an `upstream` remote).

*Example 1 - Project in user's namespace*

The insiders namespace, insiders repository name and username are inferred from the namespace and repository name.

```
insiders create \
    -n user \
    -r mkdocs-ultimate \
    -d "The ultimate plugin for MkDocs (??)" \
    -o ~/data/dev \
    -O ~/data/dev/insiders \
    -t gh:user/copier-uv

```

*Example 2 - Project in another namespace:*

The insiders namespace, insiders repository name and username are different, so must be provided explicitly:

```
insiders create \
    -n mkdocstrings \
    -r rust \
    -d "A Rust handler for mkdocstrings" \
    -o ~/data/dev \
    -O ~/data/dev/insiders \
    -N user-insiders \
    -R mkdocstrings-rust \
    -u user \
    -t gh:mkdocstrings/handler-template

```

## **`register-pypi`**

> Register a name on PyPI.

This will create a temporary project on your filesystem, then build both source and wheel distributions for it, and upload them to PyPI using Twine.

After that, you will see an initial version 0.0.0 of your project on PyPI.

*Example*

```
insiders pypi register -u user -n my-new-project -d "My new project!"

```

Credentials must be configured in `~/.pypirc` to allow Twine to push to PyPI. For example, if you use [PyPI API tokens](https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken), add the token to your keyring:

```
pipx install keyring
keyring set https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ __token__
# __token__ is a literal string, do not replace it with your token.
# The command will prompt you to paste your token.

```

And configure `~/.pypirc`:

```
[distutils]
index-servers =
    pypi

[pypi]
username: __token__

```
